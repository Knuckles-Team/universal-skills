# Web & UI Artifacts

## Overview

This skill unifies guidelines and tooling for building frontend web artifacts.

## Capabilities/Tools
We provide scripts to scaffold and bundle interactive React components using shadcn/ui and Tailwind.
- `scripts/init-artifact.sh`: Initializes a new frontend project structure.
- `scripts/bundle-artifact.sh`: Bundles the React project into a single interactive HTML file.

```bash
# Example
bash scripts/init-artifact.sh my-new-component
bash scripts/bundle-artifact.sh my-new-component
```

## Design Guidelines & Workflows
The `docs/` folder contains reference materials and standard operating procedures for achieving high-quality design outcomes:

1. **Brand Guidelines**: Always consult brand requirements when selecting colors, typography, or component styles.
2. **Figma Implementation**: When given a Figma design or mock, refer to the documentation to correctly map tokens to Tailwind classes.
3. **Frontend Architecture**: Ensure functional components are used, React hooks are managed properly, and the design is mobile-responsive.
4. **Agent UI Capabilities**: Make sure to use single-file HTML/JS bundles generated by the builder scripts to ensure compatibility with agentic browser tools.
