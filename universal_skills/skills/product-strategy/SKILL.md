# Product Strategy & Market Analysis

- **Economic**: Interest rates, inflation, consumer spending.
- **Social**: Trends, demographics, cultural shifts.
- **Technological**: AI advancements, infrastructure.
- **Environmental**: Sustainability, climate impact.
- **Legal**: Labor laws, IP protection.

### SWOT Analysis
- **Strengths/Weaknesses**: Internal factors.
- **Opportunities/Threats**: External factors.

## 2. Market Sizing (TAM/SAM/SOM)

Quantify the opportunity to ensure the investment is justified.

- **TAM (Total Addressable Market)**: Total global demand for the product category.
- **SAM (Serviceable Addressable Market)**: The portion of TAM that your business model/technology can realistically serve.
- **SOM (Serviceable Obtainable Market)**: The portion of SAM you can realistically capture in the next 1–3 years.

## 3. Market Positioning

Define how your product sits in the mind of the customer relative to the competition.

**Positioning Statement Formula**:
"For [target audience] who [statement of need], [product name] is a [product category] that [compelling benefit]. Unlike [primary competitor], we [primary differentiation]."

## 4. SaaS Economics & Metrics

Understand the "Health" of a digital product.

### Growth Metrics:
- **MRR / ARR**: Monthly / Annual Recurring Revenue.
- **NRR**: Net Revenue Retention (% of revenue kept from existing customers).
- **LTV**: Lifetime Value of a customer.
- **CAC**: Cost to Acquire a Customer.

### Efficiency Metrics:
- **LTV/CAC Ratio**: Aim for >3.0 for a healthy business.
- **Payback Period**: Months required to recover CAC.
- **Rule of 40**: Growth Rate + Profit Margin should be >40%.

## Best Practices

- **Validate Assumptions**: Market sizing is only as good as its underlying assumptions. Document your sources.
- **Competitor Obsession**: Don't just list features; understand the competitor's business model and "Gaps" in their strategy.
- **Focus on Differentiation**: Why would a customer switch from a "Good enough" existing solution to yours?
- **Link to Execution**: Strategy is useless without a roadmap that builds toward the vision.
