# Internal Communications

Craft clear, purposeful internal communications that inform, align, and motivate teams across all formats and organizational levels.

---

## Communication Types

### 1. Announcements (Team / Company-wide)

**Purpose:** Inform the team of a change, launch, or decision.

**Structure:**
```
Subject: [Direct, informative headline — include the key fact]

[Opening — lead with the news, no preamble]

What's changing:
- [Specific change 1]
- [Specific change 2]

Why we're doing this:
[1–2 sentences on the rationale]

What this means for you:
[Concrete action items or impact for the recipient]

Timeline:
- [Date]: [Milestone]

Questions? [Point of contact / channel]
```

**Tone principles:**
- Lead with the news — don't bury it
- Be direct; assume a busy reader
- Include a clear next step or action
- Avoid corporate jargon ("leverage," "synergize," "circle back")

### 2. All-Hands / Town Hall Agendas

**Purpose:** Structured agenda for company or department-wide meetings.

**Structure:**
```
[Meeting Name] — [Date] — [Duration]

Agenda

0:05–0:20  Company/Team Update (Leader)
  - [Key metric or milestone]
  - [Strategic context]
0:20–0:35  [Department/Project Spotlight] (Owner)
0:35–0:50  Q&A — open questions
0:50–0:55  Announcements & Upcoming dates
0:55–1:00  Closing

Pre-submitted questions: [link to form or doc]
Recording will be shared at: [channel/location]
```

**Tips:**
- Keep Q&A time > 15 minutes for genuine engagement
- Collect questions anonymously in advance for psychological safety
- End with a concrete takeaway or call to action

[What is this project and where does it stand?]

Progress since last update:
- ✅ [Completed]
- ✅ [Completed]

This week / next milestone:
- 🔄 [In progress]
- 📅 [Upcoming — by what date?]

Blockers & risks:
- [Blocker + who owns resolution + ETA]

Decisions needed:
- [Decision + decision maker + by when]

```

## General Writing Principles

- **One idea per sentence** — if the sentence has "and," consider splitting it
- **Active voice** — "The team shipped X" not "X was shipped by the team"
- **Concrete details** — dates, numbers, names beat vague generalities
- **Know your audience** — executives need 1 page; teams need bullet points; ICs need context
- **End with a clear next step** — every message should answer "what do I do with this?"
