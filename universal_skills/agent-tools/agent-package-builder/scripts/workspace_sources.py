"""Auto-emit + lint the root uv workspace `[tool.uv.sources]` table.

CONCEPT:OS-5.72-workspace-uv-sources — workspace-source auto-emit + drift guard.

**Root cause this closes.** The root workspace `pyproject.toml`
(`[tool.uv.workspace]` + `[tool.uv.sources]`) was a hand-edited file: whenever a
new package was scaffolded, a human had to remember to add its
`{ workspace = true }` line, and every so often a package's OWN `pyproject.toml`
would instead declare a `path = "../sibling"` source for a sibling that is
*already* a `[tool.uv.workspace]` member — uv then sees two conflicting
resolutions for the same package (a workspace member AND a path dependency) and
the lock fails or silently picks one. Both failure modes are hand-edit drift.

This module is the single source of truth for both fixes:

* :func:`resolve_workspace_members` — expand `[tool.uv.workspace].members` globs
  (honoring `exclude`) into the concrete `(dir, package_name)` pairs uv actually
  resolves, by reading each candidate's own `pyproject.toml` `[project].name`.
* :func:`sync_uv_sources` — regenerate the root `[tool.uv.sources]` table so it
  contains **exactly** one `<name> = { workspace = true }` line per resolved
  member (sorted, idempotent) — the scaffolder calls this after creating a new
  package so the root file never needs a human edit again.
* :func:`find_path_source_drift` — the lint: scan every workspace member's OWN
  `pyproject.toml` for a `[tool.uv.sources]` entry that is `{ path = "..." }`
  (or any non-`workspace = true` form) naming another resolved workspace member.
  That shape is always wrong once both packages are workspace members — the
  root file's `workspace = true` is the only correct resolution, so any such
  entry is drift, full stop.

Both the sync and the lint touch **only** the `[tool.uv.sources]` table's text —
every other line of `pyproject.toml` is preserved byte-for-byte. No TOML writer
dependency is needed (or added) because the table's own grammar
(`name = { workspace = true }` per line) is simple enough to regenerate as text.
